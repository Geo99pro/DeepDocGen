# How it works ‚ùì
```python 
from Post_processing_Folder.Post_Processing_to_remove_document_overlap.remove_overlap_engine import RemoveOverlapEngine 
remover = RemoveOverlapEngine(layout_gen_annotation_path="./test_folder",
                               vmin=0.4,
                               vmax=0.5,
                               reconstruct_image_path="D:/Meus_codigos_de_mestrado/Synthetic_document_pipeline/Post_Processing_Folder/Post_Processing_to_remove_document_overlap",
                               reconstruct_annotation_path="D:/Meus_codigos_de_mestrado/Synthetic_document_pipeline/Post_Processing_Folder/Post_Processing_to_remove_document_overlap")
corrected_overlap = remover.remove_overlap()
reconstructed_data = remover.reconstruct_normal_format(corrected_dataframe=corrected_overlap)
remover.create_image_after_correction(reconstructed_data=reconstructed_data, type_of_format="PNG")
remover.convert_to_json(reconstructed_data=reconstructed_data)
